This is a python script which converts a GIF into all the images present in it.
I have used the PIL library in Python to open and save an Image object.

The user must have PIL package installed to use this program.

1)Initially, the user must put the GIF file into the directory of the project and
must run the script.
2)The user must mention the filename of the GIF including the extension.
3)The program on execution generates all the images in a sequence numbered.
4)The user can view the all the images in the order of timeframe in which it occurs.
